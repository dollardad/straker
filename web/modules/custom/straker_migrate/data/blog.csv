Microsoft New Zealand’s managing director, Vanessa Sorensen, will lead the project.<br></p><p id="""">This partnership occurred after a meeting between Straker CEO Grant Straker and Microsoft’s president, Brad Smith, during New Zealand’s recent trade delegation to the US. The project will incorporate Straker’s existing translation software into the Microsoft Translator app, allowing people to translate online news articles into te reo Māori.</p><h2 id="""">Why Te Reo Māori?<br></h2><p id="""">Grant Straker of the Ngāti Raukawa firmly believes in preserving indigenous languages and cultures. He is proud of his Māori heritage and hopes to see the continued growth of te reo Māori in Aotearoa.</p><p id="""">Straker offers multilingual translations and services in many regions, yet of all the languages the company translates, te reo Māori is the most expensive. The lack of skilled translators for the language often drives up the price, causing many companies to exclude it from their global expansion plans.</p><p id="""">Partnering with Microsoft will hopefully make te reo Māori translations more accessible and keep Aotearoa on the map.</p><h2 id="""">How The Project Leverages the Latest Technology</h2><p id="""">This project will combine human translation with artificial intelligence, focusing on translating news articles at scale so that Māori can enjoy them in their native language.

It often requires liaising with several firms that translate a select few languages, which can cause inefficiencies, poor spend visibility, complex pricing models and serious security concerns.</p><p id="""">However, the biggest risk is the missed opportunity to win new customers and secure market share by breaking into a new market before competitors.</p><p id="""">Can the rise of progressive technologies such as AI-driven RPA (Robotic Process Automation), AI automations like speech to text, machine learning, and API related advancements remove roadblocks from translation and enhance your speed to market?</p><p id="""">In short, yes it can.</p><h2 id="""">What are multinationals doing now to improve their performance in translation?</h2><p id="""">We have seen MarTech radically transform the marketing sector in the past 10 years and the translation technology is rapidly following suit.</p><p id="""">Here are the key trends outlined in some more detail:</p><h3 id="""">Supplier Consolidation</h3><p id="""">Rather than depending on multiple translation vendors that often fall short, multinationals are consolidating their supplier bases, choosing just one that matches their broader business strategies.</p><h3 id="""">Supplier-Led Innovation</h3><p id="""">Some suppliers embrace innovation and technological development and align themselves strategically with their enterprise clients. Working with these suppliers can result in dramatic benefits for your business.</p><h3 id="""">Translation Process Audit</h3><p id="""">Many companies are auditing their translation processes, people, and technology to uncover improvements and savings. Switching to best-of-breed technology that evolves alongside your organization helps you capitalize on the value generated and let your team focus on strategic goals.</p><h3 id="""">Data-Driven Decisions</h3><p id="""">As data-driven innovation now plays a key role in business growth, many organizations are implementing better data capture and analytics processes to give them oversight and insight into their translation projects, linguists, project managers, and validators.</p><h3 id="""">Security Enhancements</h3><p id="""">Keeping data safe and secure is crucial, which means that businesses can’t afford to ignore security risks in existing translation processes.</p><h2 id="""">What are the key benefits of digital transformation in translation?</h2><p id="""">Consolidating, auditing, and improving your translation services can have significant advantages for your organization. By using powerful translation software that utilizes billions of data points, AI, smart algorithms, machine learning and Translation Memory functionality, you can:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Achieve faster turnaround times</li><li id="""">Increase productivity</li><li id="""">Measure your translation performance</li><li id="""">Lower your translation costs</li><li id="""">Improve spend visibility and transparency</li><li id="""">De-risk with better security measures</li><li id="""">Gain insight into your team’s efficiency and effectiveness</li><li id="""">Future-proof your localization with billions of data points</li></ul><p id="""">In 2020, IBM, the world leader in artificial intelligence, chose Straker as their primary Language Services Provider and we are working together to future-proof their global communications using our innovative technology stack, Ai-Powered RAY and IBM Watson’s NLP engine.</p><h2 id="""">What Should I Do Next?</h2><p id="""">Auditing your translation performance to modernize your approach is fast becoming a necessity. To remain competitive, you need to hit aggressive speed to market goals.

These subtle factors make or break your success in new markets.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Times when AI translations failed hard</strong></h4><p id="""">Without some measure of understanding your translated output, you’re in the dark about its level of accuracy – and the negative impact that a poor quality translation may have.

How Straker Verify differs from other translation platforms and services,how-straker-verify-differs-from-other-translation-platforms-and-services,65f244e982dcf483fb511592,65f244e982dcf483fb511579,68785922fd0798f066dba450,false,false,Thu Jul 17 2025 02:00:02 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Mon Jul 21 2025 07:06:52 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),Mon Jul 21 2025 07:12:35 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time),https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/65f244e982dcf483fb51158f/687862034e4c1983b8a91f92_How%20Straker%20Verify%20differs%20(1).png,"<p id="""">If you’re researching translation solutions, you’ve probably seen it all: traditional language agencies, free AI tools, legacy TMS platforms, and newer AI-powered software. They all promise speed, accuracy, and scale. But they don’t all deliver – and they definitely don’t deliver in the same way.</p><p id="""">So what makes <strong id="""">Straker Verify</strong> different?</p><p id="""">Let’s walk through the key differences so you can decide whether Verify is the right fit for your multilingual content needs.</p><h4 id="""">Why the Old Options Fall Short</h4><p id="""">Before we get into what makes Verify different, it helps to understand what buyers like you are moving away from:</p><h5 id=""""><strong id="""">1. Traditional Translation Agencies</strong></h5><p id="""">These are still the default for many companies. You send files. You wait. You pay by the word. Per word charges can be $0.08-0.15, so a 30-page report (13,500 words) translated into 3 languages could set you back over $6,000. </p><p id="""">While the quality can be high, the process is slow, expensive, and manual. Each project is a one-off – it’s not a scalable system.</p><h5 id=""""><strong id="""">2. Free AI Tools (Google Translate, DeepL)</strong></h5><p id="""">Free AI translation tools are easy to find, and they’re easy to use – if you don’t mind copy and pasting. They’re fine for casual use. But how do you know the quality is good? </p><p id="""">You don’t. </p><p id="""">But many companies are using AI translation tools – getting around the unknown quality issue by relying on a native speaker within the company to check and amend the output.</p><p id="""">This is not a long-term solution because:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">It can’t scale – one native-speaker soon becomes a bottleneck.</li><li id="""">The native speaker is not primarily employed for translation work – typically they are in sales or operations and take on this responsibility as there is nobody else who can do the job. &nbsp;</li><li id="""">They are not paid for this extra responsibility – and may experience additional pressure and stress due to the mission critical nature of the work.</li><li id="""">Their time is better spent elsewhere – like making sales. When checking translations takes them away from their core competencies, the business suffers.</li></ul><p id="""">Use of free AI translation tools works best for ad hoc jobs that don’t require guaranteed levels of quality. They also become cumbersome beyond certain limits of word count and cadence of translation i.e. you’ll be in trouble if you need to translate 10,000 words into 5 languages, 3 times a week. </p><p id="""">One last thing: if you’re using AI translation tools and your content is compliance-heavy, legally sensitive, or brand-critical – that’s a huge risk. </p><h5 id=""""><strong id="""">3. Legacy TMS Platforms</strong></h5><p id="""">Some tools solve the workflow challenge, but not the quality issue. Translation Management Systems (TMS) originated in the late 80s and became best in class technology for the next four decades. </p><p id="""">Designed with rules-based, conditional logic for workflows, they are vast, highly customizable, and sometimes bewildering environments. They’re often complex, costly to implement, and designed for localization teams with deep in-house expertise. </p><p id="""">The learning curve is steep making onboarding and training of new hires &nbsp;a challenge.</p><h4 id="""">So, what is Straker Verify?</h4><p id="""">Straker Verify is a hybrid translation platform built for modern content teams under pressure. It combines AI speed, human-level accuracy, and full transparency in a single environment.</p><p id="""">Here’s what makes it stand out:</p><h5 id=""""><strong id="""">1. AI Translation with built-in quality scoring</strong></h5><p id="""">Verify uses an advanced AI engine that scores every translated segment in real time. You don’t need to guess whether the output is usable – you’ll see immediately if it’s publish-ready, needs a light touch, or requires deeper human involvement.</p><p id="""">This is your confidence lever: finally, a way to trust AI generated content without blind spots.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">2. Human review only when needed</strong></p><p id="""">If a segment falls below your quality threshold, it’s automatically flagged for human review. You can assign it to your internal team or send to Straker’s linguists. This means:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">No more reviewing everything “just in case”</li><li id="""">You only pay for human review where it counts</li><li id="""">You keep speed without sacrificing quality</li></ul><h5 id=""""><strong id="""">3. Workflow automation with Orchestrate</strong></h5><p id="""">If you’re tired of email chains, and the time and effort that goes into managing translators, their projects and their timelines. Verify’s Orchestrate feature lightens your load.</p><p id="""">Use a simple visual builder to automatically assign workflows to content based on source, content type, or quality score. You get end-to-end automation, with full control. </p><p id="""">Here’s an example workflow:</p><p id="""">Content arrives from WordPress, Salesforce, or a folder</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">AI translates and scores it</li><li id="""">High scoring content remains untouched</li><li id="""">Low scoring content is routed for human review</li><li id="""">Once all content achieves high quality score it is published automatically</li></ul><p id="""">From assigning tasks and submitting projects to tracking progress and linking to other systems, Orchestrate gives you complete control, visibility and accelerates time to market. </p><h5 id=""""><strong id="""">4. Built for integration</strong></h5><p id="""">Translation tools should live in the same digital spaces in which you work, Verify doesn’t try to replace your systems – it fits into them. </p><p id="""">Activate translations from inside collaboration platforms like Slack or Microsoft Teams, or automation tools like n8n or Microsoft PowerAutomate.</p><p id="""">You can also connect Verify via Open APIs and available integrations make embedding Verify in custom applications easy, no matter your platform.</p><p id="""">Verify even supports advanced protocols like MCP (Model Context Protocol), ensuring cutting-edge, context-aware connections.</p><p id="""">A growing network of technology partners means you can also connect Verify’s high-quality, on-demand translation to CRM, PIM, and LMS platforms.</p><p id="""">You can translate content where it lives, without copy-paste chaos.</p><h5 id=""""><strong id="""">5. Customizable AI models trained on your data</strong></h5><p id="""">If your business translates often, you’re likely sitting on a powerful, untapped asset: your own linguistic data.</p><p id="""">Transform that data into a competitive advantage with Straker Verify’s Custom Model Creation. Get access to TIRI, our proprietary Small Language Model, and train it on your data.</p><p id="""">Custom TIRI models are game-changers. Not only do they retain your specific brand voice and terminology, but also consistently outperform machine translation and generic large language models.</p><p id="""">With Straker Verify’s Custom Models, your translations aren't just accurate; they're perfectly on-brand and uniquely yours.</p><h5 id=""""><strong id="""">6. Privacy and security you can count on</strong></h5><p id="""">Verify isn’t just fast and flexible – it’s secure by design.</p><p id="""">Unlike open AI tools that reuse data to train public models, Verify runs on a closed-loop AI stack hosted entirely by Straker. That means:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Your data is never used to train external AI models</li><li id="""">All content stays private and secure on Straker-hosted servers</li><li id="""">You retain full ownership and a full version history of every project</li></ul><p id="""">Behind the scenes, we’ve built a compliance-first system you can trust with even your most sensitive content:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Straker’s information management system is ISO/IEC 27001 certified — a globally recognized gold standard for security governance</li><li id="""">All services are hosted in IBM Cloud data centers in Europe, certified to SOC 2 and ISO 27001 standards</li><li id="""">We undergo annual third-party audits and penetration testing to continuously improve our security posture</li><li id="""">Straker complies with the GDPR (EU General Data Protection Regulation), reflecting our strong focus on data privacy and protection for EU personal data.</li></ul><p id="""">This multilayered approach meets the expectations of even the most cautious IT and compliance teams. You can confidently run Verify in regulated, high-stakes environments – legal, financial, or manufacturing – without sacrificing performance or peace of mind.</p><p id="""">It’s translation you can trust, &nbsp;even with your legal team at the table.</p><h5 id=""""><strong id="""">7. Pricing that aligns with value</strong></h5><p id="""">You don’t pay per word or per hour. You buy tokens in bundles with a credit card. These tokens never expire and you spend them only when you use the platform. You can:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Upload a batch of content</li><li id="""">Review the quality scores</li><li id="""">Decide where to spend tokens on human verification</li><li id="""">Stay in control of your costs</li></ul><p id="""">It’s translation on your terms — not a meter running in the background.</p><h5 id=""""><strong id="""">8. Collaboration without friction</strong></h5><p id="""">While AI translation gets you most of the way there, content perfection often requires a human touch.</p><p id="""">With Verify's Collaborate feature, your team or external partners can work on content from inside the platform. Collaborate makes it easy to bring people into the process – right where they add the most value – turning human verification into a vital reinforcement layer for your AI model. No attachments. No version control issues. Just a clean, shared workspace built for speed.</p><p id="""">Collaborate provides a unified workspace where native-speakers, subject matter experts, and stakeholders can review, edit, and approve translations in real-time.</p><p id="""">And every approved translation feeds the AI, so it gets smarter over time.</p><h4 id="""">Is Straker Verify a good fit for me?</h4><p id="""">Straker Verify is ideal for you if you’re part of a company that:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Translates legal, technical, or regulated content at volume</li><li id="""">Has multilingual needs across product, sales, and marketing</li><li id="""">Is looking to reduce translation costs</li><li id="""">Is frustrated with slow agency workflows or inconsistent freelancers</li><li id="""">Wants to scale without scaling headcount</li><li id="""">Needs translation to integrate with existing tools and processes</li></ul><h4 id="""">When it’s not the right fit</h4><p id="""">Verify may not be right for you if your company is:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Comfortable with your legacy system</li><li id="""">Has translation needs which are small and infrequent</li><li id="""">happy with the speed and service of your current translation agency </li><li id="""">Not ready to adopt AI in your content workflow</li></ul><h4 id="""">Choose a platform that works like you do</h4><p id="""">There are many things to consider when choosing an AI translation technology platform. Most are related to how well the features of the platform align with your needs. But these are the key things to consider beyond that:</p><ul id=""""><li id="""">Costs. Will &nbsp;you be paying a yearly fee upfront or on a per-usage basis?</li><li id="""">Limits. Is there a cap on the number of users or the number of words you can translate?</li><li id="""">How is human verification handled? Are you required to source and manage your own translators or is this conducted in another way?</li><li id="""">Dormancy and expiration. Do you continue to pay for features during periods of inactivity? What items have limited usage periods or expiry dates?</li><li id="""">Free trial. Can you explore the fully featured version at no cost?</li><li id="""">Productivity metrics and ROI. Based on the free trial, how much time, money and effort do you estimate you’ll save? How do these align with your targets?</li><li id="""">Cancellation. What is the cancellation and refund policy?</li><li id="""">Education and training. How easy is it to train your team to use the new platform?</li></ul><p id="""">Mostly these are trade-offs. What are your deal breakers?</p><p id="""">Straker believes the future of translation isn’t about replacing humans or doing everything with AI. It’s about building a platform where <strong id="""">AI handles the heavy lifting, and humans ensure quality</strong> — all in a way that’s fast, scalable, and secure.</p><p id="""">Straker Verify gives you the power to do exactly that.</p>",,,false,2,Mon Jul 14 2025 00:00:00 GMT+0000 (Coordinated Universal Time)

In 2019 only ~13% of translation projects for end clients used MT.</p><p id="""">However, rapid improvements in quality and efficiency drove wider uptake. By 2020, roughly 24% of projects involved MT – nearly double the previous year.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">The advent of true <em id="""">large language models</em> around 2022 gave an additional boost to the automation of translation workflows.</p><p id="""">Today, integration of LLMs into translation workflows is virtually standard practice at all tech-forward organizations.</p><p id="""">Nimdzi analysts note that <em id="""">“the new wave of AI tools, such as large language models (LLMs) [and] LLM-enhanced machine translation, ... are quickly finding their way into translation workflows”</em> as features inside translation management systems, content platforms, subtitling tools and more.</p><p id="""">In short, what was a niche, experimental technology just over five years ago has become a core component of translation and localization operations today.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Generalists can never outperform specialists</strong><br><br>Large Language Models are hugely powerful, flexible, and can execute on general tasks extremely well. However, their capacity to perform well in general tasks and the breadth of training data that informs this capability is the very reason for their predicted demise when it comes to translating content.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">The limitations of general purpose LLMs</strong></h4><p id="""">General purpose LLMs generate human-like text across many topics but often miss subtle, domain-specific nuances for industry categories.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">For example, when translating a financial report, a generic model might misinterpret the term “equity.” Generally, equity is used most commonly in a real estate context to describe the difference between the market value and the outstanding mortgage of a property. However, in accounting, equity refers to ownership value in a company or assets.</p><p id="""">Without understanding these distinctions, the LLM can produce inaccurate translations or interpretations that jeopardize the accuracy of critical communications.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Generic output requires greater human validation</strong></h4><p id="""">Because these broad models require significant computing power, the cost of running them is high and delivery can be slow. Their lack of specialization also means more human editing is needed, reducing efficiency and increasing turnaround times.</p><p id="""">On large projects, these factors translate into higher costs and slower results—directly impacting the quality and reliability your business depends on.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Introducing the Small Language Model (SLM)</strong></h4><p id="""">“Good things come in small packages”, or so the saying goes. Our experience at Straker was discovering the true power of custom small language models.</p><p id="""">Unlike general-purpose LLMs – which are a jack-of-all trades – we’ve found success in building and training SLMs, targeted for specific industries or tasks.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">By focusing exclusively on localization, our models have achieved unmatched accuracy and nuanced understanding, mastering industry jargon, technical terms, and linguistic complexities where generic models falter.</p><h4 id=""""><strong id="""">Meet Tiri: Straker’s Specialized Language Model Family</strong></h4><p id="""">Straker built Tiri as a family of small, <a href=""https://www.straker.ai/ai-solutions/custom-ai-models"" id="""">specialized AI models</a> designed specifically for localization.

The truth might surprise you.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">Despite leaps in AI and automation, translation remains tangled in complexities that trip up even the smartest companies.</p><p id="""">‍<strong id="""">Here are five reasons why translation still causes bottlenecks — and how you can break free.</strong></p><h5 id="""">1. <strong id="""">Language is more than words – it’s culture and context</strong></h5><p id="""">Automated tools translate sentences, but they can’t always capture the cultural nuances or tone that make your message resonate. These tools are unaware of the unique traditions, customs, values and idioms of each culture.</p><p id="""">A 2025 research indicates that up to <a href=""https://www.appen.com/blog/ai-translation-preserving-cultural-nuance?utm_source=chatgpt.com"" id="""">47% of contextual meaning is lost in traditional machine translation</a> due to cultural misinterpretation and lack of contextual awareness. For legal or marketing content, that’s a risk you can’t afford.</p><h5 id="""">2. <strong id="""">Fragmented workflows and multiple tools</strong></h5><p id="""">For most companies, multi-lingual content generation and quality assurance requires the movement of files between different teams and tools. Documents are passed around, manual checks are needed, email threads are lengthy. These cause delays that quickly add up.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">Old CAT (computer-assisted translation) tools don’t always work smoothly with new AI platforms, so translators end up waiting.</p><h5 id="""">3<strong id="""">. Quality assurance can’t be rushed</strong></h5><p id="""">Technical or regulated content requires highly accurate translations which means quality assurance often involves multiple rounds of reviews from human experts. Without integrated review tools that provide visibility to the whole team, this step creates a significant bottleneck that delays publishing.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">According to a 2025 <a href=""https://www.verbolabs.com/translation-quality-assurance-in-projects/"" id="""">study by VerboLabs</a>, 89% of global companies using AI in content production still rely on human review to ensure accuracy and cultural alignment, proving that human oversight remains crucial to quality.</p><h5 id=""""><strong id="""">4. Scaling to many markets isn’t easy</strong></h5><p id="""">Expanding globally means translating more content into more languages – quickly. But there’s only so much skilled linguist bandwidth, especially in niche industries. Limited talent availability slows down the entire pipeline.</p><h5 id=""""><strong id="""">5. AI-human teamwork is the winning formula</strong></h5><p id="""">Pure AI can’t replace human judgment – at least not yet. But the right AI that learns your brand voice, paired with expert human editors, cuts bottlenecks dramatically.&nbsp;</p><p id="""">Humans can also be involved in training custom AI models, using their knowledge and expertise to evolve the AI.

This reduces friction and makes translations faster and more accessible.”</p><p id="""">Today, <strong id="""">10,000</strong> IBM employees actively use the Straker app each month, translating between <strong id="""">40 and 50 million words</strong>. Teams can upload documents or presentations directly into Slack, and the app translates the content and returns it within seconds.</p><p id="""">The app also supports real-time multilingual collaboration in Slack <a href=""https://slack.com/intl/en-au/features/channels"" target=""_blank"" id="""">channels</a>. For example, IBM teams in Japan and the US can seamlessly collaborate. One team member types in English, the other responds in Japanese, and the app instantly translates both messages, ensuring clarity and precision.</p><p id=""""><a target=""_blank"" id="""">Doug Mueller</a>, Senior Program Manager at IBM, describes the impact:</p><blockquote id="""">‍<em id="""">“Slack’s asynchronous nature and the ease of use of the Straker integration is leveling. It boosts productivity and engagement across global teams.”</em></blockquote><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Reducing friction across the product lifecycle</strong></h3><p id="""">Translation was once a bottleneck for IBM. A single 10,000-word document could take up to a week to process, involving multiple steps and touchpoints along the way.<em id=""""> </em><strong id=""""><em id="""">Now, with the Straker app in Slack, those same requests are completed in just 0.7 seconds.</em></strong></p><p id="""">This speed is a game changer in avoiding critical bottlenecks during the key stages of product development, testing, and global rollout. Together, Slack and Straker help IBM maintain momentum, eliminating barriers and keeping teams aligned across languages and time zones.</p><p id="""">“From development to testing, launching, and supporting products globally, we need solutions that eliminate friction and keep teams aligned,” explains Mueller. “Slack and Straker make that possible.”</p><p id="""">Unlike web-based tools, the Slack app is designed to meet IBM’s enterprise needs, delivering tailored translations that ensure precision, maintain tone, and <a href=""https://slack.com/intl/en-au/trust/security"" target=""_blank"" id="""">protect sensitive data</a> — all while providing the agility required for a global business. </p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">Shaping the future of translation with AI agents</strong></h3><p id="""">Straker is pioneering the future of translation with <a href=""https://slack.com/intl/en-au/ai-agents"" target=""_blank"" id="""">AI-powered agents</a> in Slack. These agents will work alongside teams to refine machine translations, adapt content for specific use cases like marketing or technical documentation, and suggest quality improvements.</p><p id="""">“Agents are where translation is headed,” says Sowerby. “Imagine a quality boost agent fine-tuning translations or a style agent adapting language for different audiences. In Slack, these agents will drive efficiency and precision.”</p><p id="""">By combining human expertise with AI, Straker’s language agents will allow IBM to scale translations globally without compromising quality. This approach also reduces human workload significantly. For example, tasks that previously required manual translation of 900 out of 1,000 words now only need human input for 100 words.</p><p id="""">Sowerby adds, “This shift reduces costs by a factor of four or five while maintaining high-quality results. It’s about balancing quality and cost efficiency to deliver the best outcomes.”</p><p id="""">As IBM continues to scale, Slack and Straker are setting a new standard for translation — integrating cutting-edge technology with workflows to drive better outcomes for teams worldwide.</p><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">📝 Key Takeaways</strong></h3><ul id=""""><li id="""">Fast, accurate translation: Slack and Straker reduce translation times from a week to under a second.</li><li id="""">Simplified communication: Straker’s app unlocks real-time multilingual collaboration directly in Slack.</li><li id="""">Global efficiency: Slack acts as IBM’s central hub for managing translations and aligning teams worldwide.</li><li id="""">Future-ready solutions: AI-powered translation agents will streamline workflows and elevate translation quality, cutting costs significantly.</li></ul><h3 id=""""><strong id="""">How the Straker App for Slack helps global teams work better, faster, and smarter 💡</strong></h3><p id=""""><strong id="""">Communicate seamlessly with your global team in any language.</strong></p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Localize content and documents without needing to leave Slack. </strong>Get <em id="""">instant</em> document translations and video transcriptions in multiple languages.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Create content that resonates with your global market. </strong>Get <em id="""">instant</em> document translations and video transcriptions in multiple languages.</p><p id=""""><strong id="""">Get quality evaluation of AI-translated files and send it for human verification--<em id="""">if needed!</em> </strong>Our unique AI model evaluates the quality of translation and gets smarter with every use.
